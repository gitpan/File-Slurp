	- Slurping the DATA handle now works without the workaround.
	  tests are in t/data_scalar.t and t/data_list.t
        - Paragraph mode in read_file is supported. As with <> when $/
	  (input record separator) is set to '', then the input file is
	  split on multiple newlines (/\n\n+/).
	  Thanks to Geoffrey Leach <geoff@direcway.com>

9999.07  Tue Jan 25 01:33:11 EST 2005
	- Slurping in pseudo files (as in /proc) which show a size of 0
	  but actually have data works. This seems to be the case on
	  linux but on Solaris those files show their proper size.
	  Thanks to Juerd Waalboer <juerd@cpan.org>
